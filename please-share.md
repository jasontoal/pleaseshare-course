
## DAY 1


### Overview

In this course we are going to examine different web based tools that educators may consider for bringing engagement through multimedia to their hybrid learning activities. This is meant as an introductory course for those that do not have much experience in web publishing, which is essentially the practice we are wading into. As such I have tried to keep the material accessible, and use as little technical jargon as possible, but there will be some! So let’s stay in touch! There will be an open dialogue in the course forum that you may be able to ask specific questions, and I will be hosting two synchronous sessions on Tuesday and Friday so we will have a chance to share and showcase our progress.

Participants will have the opportunity to explore a selection of platforms that are quite powerful and are intended (in most cases) to do much more than create a simple portfolio or gallery. A lot of bells and whistles. This course will focus on those features for displaying and sharing and collaborating with media primarily. There are some further definitions of terms below, but each media type (images, audio, video, documents, interactives) have their own constraints, so to keep things simple the examples used will be those using images. Other media types will be mentioned, but in most cases take more time and resources to present. I will follow the needs of the cohort this week and see where it takes us! 

If you have any concerns or feedback about the material or activities, please use the available discussion forums or feel free to contact me at [jason.toal@gmail.com](mailto:jason.toal@gmail.com).


#### Outcomes

In this course participants will


* Examine web tools for sharing media including [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), and [Github (pages)](https://github.com/).
* Contribute your media collection to these platforms, to see. 
* Develop a website to showcase your media collection, a portfolio.
* Creating an online gallery to facilitate student media sharing and collaboration


#### Preamble

If you have been teaching in post-secondary education these past few years you would have become familiar with your particular institution's chosen online learning platform, commonly referred to as a Learning Management System (LMS) and you may already be familiar with its features and constraints. 

Working as an educational technologist and consultant during this time, I have had the opportunity to support many instructors that have been trying to emulate their in-person teaching methods by using one of these systems, and have noticed there can be a gap between what the LMS is capable of and the desired outcome, or what we can call the “user-experience”. Most notably in terms of sharing and collaborating with multimedia such as images, audio and video, the LMS does not always provide the types of experiences that people have come to expect from modern websites such as interactive image galleries, videos with comments or the ability for groups to collaborate and add their own media to a single collection for a discussion or critique. 

Instructors will do their best given the tools that they are provided and try to make the activity fit to the features their system includes. In some cases they will seek out external web services or tools that specialize in the types of user experience they are looking for, but quickly come up against a steeper learning curve than expected or run into barriers protecting student privacy or discover that these services only provide limited functionality for free (freemium). At this point they will get in touch with an educational technologist at their teaching and learning centre for a consultation. 

It is through some of these requests that I developed the idea for this micro-course. It is my hope that through this week you will become more comfortable exploring “outside the LMS” and discover some new methods that can bring engagement with multimedia to your students.


### Meet your Instructor

Hi! I'm Jason Toal, welcome to this FLO-micro course and thanks for joining me.

&lt;AUDIO>


#### ACTIVITY 1.0 Getting to know you

_Please, share with the class_ by posting in the discussion forum a bit about yourself. You can include your name, position or title, the institution you work for, the field in which you teach or study, and something you are known for. We are only learning together for the next week but making an effort to build our community will be a fun part of our time and make it easier to provide informative feedback on each other's projects. 



* Do you have any example websites that you are trying to mimic or create? 


### List of terms

The terms ‘gallery’ and ‘portfolio’ are taken from the worlds of art and design and have distinct uses. A portfolio is ‘_a collection of drawings, documents, etc. that represent a person's, especially an artist's, work_’. A gallery is ‘a_ room or building that is used for showing works of art, sometimes so that they can be sold_.’ If there is a distinction between them it may be the size of the container, where a portfolio can be carried while a gallery needs to be entered. A portfolio's contents can be shown sequentially, flipped through like a book, while in a gallery the viewer can observe many of its contents at the same time. 

For educational purposes and the sake of this course these can be referred to simply as a ‘collection’. Whether you are showing them in class, as an assignment or to provide evidence of work completed.

**GitHub Pages**


### What is your educational context?

Before we begin with the nerdy stuff we should ground our exploration in the appropriate context, that of teaching and learning. For each of the tools I will be introducing you to, I will include a use case that will describe an eg that the tool was used for.  We will have a chance to discuss these use cases in the discussion forum and you will have the opportunity to share an example of your own.


#### ⭐ ACTIVITY 1.1 Use Cases

**This activity will be a requirement to receive the first badge. Please read the use case below, then make a post in the discussion forum. We are hoping to gather more use cases from a variety of disciplines. The more the better! **

**Use Case 1 (READ)**

Sometime during the first ‘pivot’ to online learning in 2020, I was working at Simon Fraser University. Everyone was trying to figure out all the things and, in particular, how to deliver the kinds of teaching they had been doing in the classroom, and make those interactions engaging and simple on their online platforms.  At SFU we were using the Canvas learning management system (LMS) and although it is a useful and fairly flexible tool, there were just some interactions it was not capable of duplicating.

….

**Activity 1.1 (POST)**

_Please, share with the class_ your example or use case of how you have had, or would like to use media in your teaching. Use the discussion forum to make a post and if possible try and include the following information. 


#### ACTIVITY 1.2 Getting organized

You may think you are dealing with ‘photos’ or ‘films’ or ‘soundtracks’ but at the end of the day these are just files. Organizing your files is an essential first step to building any portfolio.  You want to make sure everything is one place and easily accessible for you, as well as being backed up and properly labeled. 

**Make a project folder**

**Rename your files**

## DAY 2

In today's session we are going to check in on our own educational context, what kind of media collections we are working and have our first chance to contribute to the micro-course media gallery. Please, share with the class [https://pleaseshare.opened.ca/](https://pleaseshare.opened.ca/)  


#### Synchronous Session - Design planning and first post

In today's session we are going to meet up to discuss our individual educational context, discuss the use case provided as well as any others that may have been shared. As part of the planning process we are going to describe the type of user experience we are hoping to achieve with our learning activity. Some questions that may emerge include



* What is in your media collections and are you ready to begin uploading? 
* Can you describe the overall structure of your collection?  
* Are you looking to make a portfolio of gallery websites? 
* Will this be to present a collection of your media, or that of your students? 
* Is this an activity that you have been able to easily teach in class?
* What barriers has an online or hybrid environment presented in facilitating a similar user-experience?

Before diving in to create our own website on any platform, we will take a closer look at a web service that utilizes Wordpress themes to simplify the process of design, with the intention of making the collaboration and engagement with a group as easy as it can be.  It was the eg given form our first use case and is called a SPLOT.

## DAY 3

We will be exploring three very different platforms in this course, each of which has its own methods for publishing. They are actually quite unique in the way they have been designed and what they are intended to do. Each of them are what I would call powerhouses of web publishing, that are able to accomplish much more than simply publishing media to the web.  So why did I think it was important to showcase the 3 of them in a single course, when they could each take a full course of their own to fully get the benefits of all the features?


#### ⭐ ACTIVITY 3.0 Create your first Wordpress website

**This activity will be a requirement to receive the third badge. Review the options below for making a Wordpress website through the OpenETC, which may use the SPLOT TRU Collector theme (beginner) or a default theme (intermediate). You may also us your own institutions Wordpress service (intermediate), or go for a self hosted option (expert). **

#### ACTIVITY 3.1 Upload your media collection

Congratulations! Now that you have a website of your own to work on you are ready to customize the look of it, and upload your media collection.



1. Review your collection from Activity 1.2 making sure your file sizes are OK for online presentation and your filenames are clear and recognizable to you. 
2. Upload each image or other media type and add a simple description or any other meta data. 
3. Keep accessibility in mind. Wordpress makes it simple to add detailed descriptions fron the media library in the dashboard.
